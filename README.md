## Sequences
Levels are organized into sequences/chapters, which riff off the same concept. I want to explore the "idea-space" of a mechanic in this way.
Examples of this are:
- Have the same layout, but vastly different solutions, caused by small differences
- Have different layouts but similar solutions
- etc.
This sequence explores the ways of transporting the player across a gap, by arranging the black blocks in the right sequence.
insert gif of the sequence
insert discription of the different levels and how they comment on each other
